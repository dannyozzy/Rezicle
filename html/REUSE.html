        <h1>Reuse: In-Kind Donation Drives</h1>
        
        <p>DonationMatch’s guide to in-kind donations defines this type of giving program as non-cash contributions that typically include products, supplies, and equipment.  Businesses, major organizations, and even individuals can participate in these types of fundraising campaigns. Additionally, these events allow your organization to directly get a hold of lucrative goods and services for auctions, internal use, or even sales to a third-party seller. </p>
        
        <p>On top of all of these benefits, in-kind fundraising is also a great way to repurpose items that your donors no longer need. To keep valuable, reusable items from ending up in a landfill, consider the following easy and accessible in-kind donation drives: </p>
        
        <p>Hopefully, our pandemic era of virtual engagement has prepared you to launch an online fundraiser, but here are a few additional tips to improve your online campaigns: </p>
        
        <li><a><strong>Shoe drive fundraisers.</strong>  Who doesn’t have an extra pair of shoes in their closet that’s simply taking up space? Do your donors, the planet, and your organization a favor by opening up a donation drive for gently worn, new, and used shoes. A shoe drive fundraising coordinator can help plan and manage the entire event, allowing your team to collect contributions from across your community and rehome them for a profit to a third-party organization. </a></li>
        
        <li><a><strong>Food drive fundraisers.</strong> Food waste is a rising crisis among developed countries, producing and disposing of food products in massive quantities. Fight this growing issue, increase revenue, and reduce food insecurity in your community by collecting canned and non-perishable food items and redistributing them to reputable sellers in your local area. </a></li>
            
        <li><a><strong>Denim drive fundraisers. </strong>  Like shoes, jeans, and other denim clothing are often overflowing within your supporters’ closets. Partner with a clothing seller to make the most of these excess clothing items, reduce product waste, and make a profit, all without asking donors for a dollar.  </a></li>
            
            
        <p><br>You don’t always have to ask your supporters for money. Instead, alternative giving campaigns such as in-kind donation drives give you the chance to make an immediate, direct change to product waste in your area and significantly raise your incoming revenue while doing so. </p>
