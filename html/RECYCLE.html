        <h1>Recycle: Green Challenges & Volunteer Events</h1>
            
        <p><br>In the previous section, we examined how you could turn unwanted and even used goods into revenue for your organization and fulfilling engagement opportunities for your supporters. We will now explore how your team can use garbage and waste to launch creative, engaging recycling campaigns to take things a step further!</p>
        
        <br><strong>Green Challenges </strong>
            
        <p>Who doesn’t love a challenge? By initiating short-term, competitive fundraising initiatives among your supporters, such as who can donate the most recycled goods, you can bring out a bit of healthy competition and further encourage donors to work towards the success of your event.</p>
            
        <br><p>For example, some eco-friendly initiatives could include:</p>

        <li><a><strong>Mud run shoe drive fundraisers.</strong>  Similar to regular shoe drive fundraisers, mud run shoe drive fundraisers transform this event into an opportunity to recycle less well-maintained items by collecting gently used but dirty shoes. These goods can then be recycled and remade into new footwear. Again, a shoe drive fundraising coordinator can manage this simple yet surprisingly lucrative event. </a></li>
        
        <li><a><strong>Aluminum runs.</strong> Dare your donors to clean up your local area by collecting all of the discarded aluminum in their homes and around their communities. Then measure their hauls and announce winners for the clean-up run, distributing prizes for participants who collected the most recyclables. These campaigns can also get repurposed for other types of recyclable waste, like plastic bottles. Additionally, your team can contact a local grocery store to process these recyclables and establish a valuable partnership opportunity with a local business. </a></li>
            
        <li><a><strong>Peer-to-peer recycling challenges.</strong>  Social media is a great place to launch a viral challenge for your supporters. Facebook Groups, in particular, are well-suited to host peer-to-peer recycling challenges. For instance, people could collect one bag of recyclable waste and share a photo, which will allow your donors to publicly show their support and expose your campaign to a broader audience.  </a></li>
            
            
        <p><br>These are just the beginning of the wacky, wonderful, and surprisingly lucrative fundraising initiatives that your organization can launch for its green campaign. For example, this Funds2Orgs 100+ unique fundraising ideas guide names dozens of other eco-friendly fundraising initiatives, such as themed fun runs or virtual 5Ks, to engage supporters in your green campaigns!  </p>
            
        <p><br><strong>Volunteer Events</strong></p>
            
        <p><br>If your organization doesn’t already have a volunteer program, then now is the time to begin rolling one out. These engaging programs can boost long-term donor retention and support for your organization, as well as qualify your organization for lucrative volunteer grant funds. </p>
            
        <p><br>Additionally, volunteers give your most passionate supporters the opportunity to freely, charitably complete major projects for your organization. </p>
            
        <p><br>For your green campaigns, be sure to create volunteer events that encourage local community members to clean up their parks, public spaces, and towns. These campaigns can be themed and adjusted seasonally for maximum engagement. </p>
            
        <p><br>For example, a school fundraising version of this event could call for students and parents to gather together around particularly dirty parts of your local area, such as a badly littered park. You can give these volunteers garbage bags and gloves to collect as much waste as possible, then be shuttle them back to your school to reconvene and celebrate your collective efforts.  </p>
                       
        <p><br>These “clean parties” not only increase engagement for your supporters, but they expose your brand to the larger community, boosting the possibility of future revenue streams and donor acquisition. </p>
