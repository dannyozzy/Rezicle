        <h1>Reduce:Go Paperless with Online Fundraising</h1>
        
        <p>When people think of reducing their waste, they usually imagine shopping for LED bulbs and separating their paper and plastic. True, these are both critical first steps to becoming more environmentally conscious. But online fundraising is another, potentially far greater way that you can increase revenue while reducing your effect on the environment. </p>
        
        <p>For example, virtual fundraisers eliminate the physical waste and cost associated with planning and creating in-person events. On top of that, online fundraising campaigns can be easily automated and optimized with software solutions to take the strain off of your team.</p>
        
        <p>Hopefully, our pandemic era of virtual engagement has prepared you to launch an online fundraiser, but here are a few additional tips to improve your online campaigns: </p>
        
        <li><a><strong>Optimize your website.</strong> From providing a portal for your online event to hosting your donation page, your website is your greatest virtual fundraising tool, so making a good impression is a major concern. Navigation menus, mobile optimization, and a simplified frontend design are just a few ways you can improve your website. Additionally, you might even find a website builder to streamline the entire process.</a></li>
        
        <li><a><strong>Roll out digital marketing strategies.</strong> Most fundraising teams already utilize email marketing, and it’s no wonder why—studies show that email has the highest ROI of any other marketing channel. But pairing your email marketing with social media, email blasts, and SMS or text invitations can create an even more powerful, paperless multichannel marketing approach. Market your upcoming fundraiser with a sophisticated online promotional campaign that reaches your supporters on the platforms they use the most. </a></li>
            
        <li><a><strong>Invest in fundraising event software.</strong> Successfully managing an online fundraising campaign can be a challenging task. Luckily, event management software can help you plan, host, and track the entire event, even if you opt for an in-person or hybrid fundraiser rather than an entirely virtual one. From Facebook peer-to-peer campaigns to online auctions, there are dozens of dedicated or all-in-one event management solutions to help you facilitate your next event. </a></li>
            
            
        <p><br>With social distancing policies rolling back and in-person engagement once again becoming a possibility, you may get tempted to leave behind your virtual and hybrid event techniques. Instead, we urge you to use these effective online fundraising strategies to maximize your incoming revenue while minimizing environmental waste.</p>
